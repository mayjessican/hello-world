## About:
This is a React Native Mobile application. Where the user can log in and send the following types of messages: text, location, image from library, or a new photo.

## Getting Started:
In order to run the app, install Expo by running npm install expo-cli -g as well in the project directory.
Download the Expo app on your smartphone or emulator by clicking [here](https://expo.io).

To start the app, run npm start or expo start in the project directory.

## Database Information:
Currently this is set up on my testing account firebase database for learning purposes. No login required, just enter your name, click the color of the background you would like, and click to start chatting. However, in order to set up your own database for Google [Firebase/Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs), please see the following information:

* Go to Google Firebase and click on “Sign in”
* Click on the “Go to console” link and click on "Create Project"
* A form will appear asking for basic information.
* Give a project name.
* With the default settings selected, agree to the terms and click “Create Project.”
* Create a database, click on “Develop” from the menu on the left-hand side.
* From the additional menu that appears, select “Database”.
* Choose “Create database” in the Cloud Firestore section.
* Make sure to create a Firestore Database—not a “Realtime Database.”

Install all dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
